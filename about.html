                    There are two basic aspects of Natya Shastra:
                    Lasya & Tandava
                    <br>
                    Lasya: It denotes grace, bhava, rasa and abhinaya. It is symbolic to the feminine features
                    of dance as an art form.
                    <br>
                    Tandava: This is symbolic to the male aspects of dance and has more emphasis on rhythm and
                    movement.
                    <br><br>
                    The three basic elements of a classical dance act are:
                    <br>
                    Nritta – These are the basic dance steps and are performed rhythmically but devoid of any expression
                    or mood.
                    <br>
                    Natya – It means dramatic representations and refers to the story that is elaborated through the
                    dance recital.
                    <br>
                    Nritya – It refers to the sentiment and the emotions evoked through dance. It includes the mime and
                    the different methods of expression including mudras in the dance.

                    5 Types of Western Dance<br><br>

                    1. Hip-Hop Dance
                    This is done to hip-hop music. It is a street dancing style. This dance has moves which are close to
                    the ground. Balancing your body on your hands and head is an essential part of this dance.<br>

                    2. Break Dancing
                    This was made famous by Michael Jackson. It consists of many acrobatic and gymnastic movements.<br>

                    3. Ballet
                    Ballet originated in Italy in the fifteenth century. The dance is performed on classical music. It
                    involves dancing on your tip-toes, known as pointe work.<br>

                    4. Salsa
                    The Salsa originated in Cuba and Puerto Rico. It is performed on salsa or Latin-American music.
                    Salsa dancing involves the shifting of body weight using the feet. The upper body remains
                    straight<br>

                    5. Tap Dancing
                    A tapping sound is created by the metal plates on the dancer’s shoe, in the ball and heel position.
                    Dancers move on a hard surface to make different sounds. So, they are also thought to be musicians.
                    This dance was first performed in the 1800s.<br>
